/** @file
@brief The Priority Queue Interface

A priority queue offers simple, fast, pointer stable management of a priority
queue. Push is `O(1)`. The cost to execute the increase key in a max heap and
decrease key in a min heap is `O(1)`. However, due to the restructuring this
causes that increases the cost of later pops, the more accurate runtime is
`o(log(N))`. The cost of a pop operation is `O(log(N))`.

To shorten names in the interface, define the following preprocessor directive
at the top of your file.

```
#define PRIORITY_QUEUE_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
```

All types and functions can then be written without the `CCC_` prefix. */
