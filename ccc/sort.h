@brief The C Container Collection Sorting Interface

These functions sort various containers with different algorithms depending on
the container. Many more sorting algorithms will likely be added here in the
future. Containers such as the buffer and linked lists do not own comparators
upon initialization because sorting is not the most common use case. Therefore
comparators are adaptors we can pass while performing an algorithm. They
then implement this algorithm internally with the passed ordering and
comparator. A container such as a linked list may also be able to report back
if it is sorted or insert an element in a sorted position. */

/** @brief Sorts the input buffer in `O(N * log(N))` time and `O(1)` space
according to the desired input order.
@param[in] buffer the buffer to be modified and sorted in place.
@param[in] temp a pointer to a dummy user type that will be used for swapping.
@param[in] order the desired order of the sorted buffer. CCC_ORDER_LESSER places
elements in non-decreasing order starting from index `[0, N)`, where N is the
count of the buffer. CCC_ORDER_GREATER places elements in non-increasing order
starting from index `[0, N)`, where N is the count of the buffer. This is done
to remain consistent with heap order, where CCC_ORDER_LESSER places the minimum
element at index 0 and CCC_ORDER_GREATER places the maximum element at index 0
because 0 is the root of the tree in either heap ordering.
@param[in] comparator the comparator context for comparing buffer elements.
@return the result of the sorting operation. If an argument input error occurs
an input error result is provided. Allocation is not needed to sort elements in
the buffer so memory related errors are not possible if the provided buffer is
initialized correctly.
@warning Assumes the input buffer has been correctly initialized via its
interface.

An easy way to provide a temp slot is with an anonymous compound literal such
as `&(My_type){}`, passed directly as an argument.

The sort is not inherently stable and uses the provided comparison function to
order the elements. */
