@brief The Tree Map Interface

A tree map offers insertion, removal, and searching with a strict bound of
`O(log(N))` time. The map is pointer stable. This map is suitable for realtime
environments. Searching is a thread-safe read-only operation. Balancing
modifications only occur upon insertion or removal.

To shorten names in the interface, define the following preprocessor directive
at the top of your file.

```
#define TREE_MAP_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
```

All types and functions can then be written without the `CCC_` prefix. */
