@brief Private Flat Hash Map Interface

This flat hash map is a C Container Collection friendly interpretation of the
Rust Hashbrown hash table. This in turn is based on the Abseil flat hash table
from Google in C++. I simplified and modified the implementation for maximum
readability in one header and one file. Tracking how to manage different
platform implementations of groups and metadata fingerprint masks should be
much easier this way, rather than jumping across countless small implementation
files.

One key feature that is rigorously tested via static asserts is the ability
to create a static data segment or stack based map. This is a key feature of
the implementation but it requires significant set up ahead of time and lazy
initialization support. The lazy initialization presents the map with the
most complexity in the implementation. */

Rust's Hashbrown table. The only value not represented by constants is
the following:

`DELETED  = 0b10000000`
`EMPTY    = 0x11111111`
`OCCUPIED = 0b0???????`

In this case `?` represents any 7 bits kept from the upper 7 bits of the
original hash code to signify an occupied slot. We know this slot is taken
because the Most Significant Bit is zero, something that is not true of any
other state. Wrap a byte in a struct to avoid strict-aliasing exceptions that
are granted to `uint8_t` (usually unsigned char) and `int8_t` (usually char)
when passed to functions as pointers. Maybe nets performance gain but depends on
aggressiveness of compiler. */

/** @internal The layout of the map uses only pointers to account for the
possibility of memory provided from the data segment, stack, or heap. When the
map is allowed to allocate it will take care of aligning pointers appropriately.
In the fixed size case we rely on the user defining a fixed size type. In either
case the arrays are in one contiguous allocation but split as follows:

N is capacity - 1, where capacity is a power of 2. G is group size - 1.

└─────────────┘ └──────────────┘ └──────────────────────────────────────────┘

This is a different layout than Rust's Hashbrown table. Instead of a shared
base address of the data and tag arrays with padding at the start of the data
array, we use a normal two array layout with padding between. This is because
we must allow the user to allocate a hash table at compile time in the data
segment or on the stack. The fixed size map defined at compile time is a struct
and structs in the C standard are specified to have no padding at the start.
Therefore, so that the code within the map does not care whether it deals with
a fixed or dynamic map, we must assume data starts at the base address and that
there may be zero or more bytes of padding between the data and tag arrays for
alignment.

We may lose some of the assembly optimizations in indexing that Rust's table
gets by adding and subtracting from a shared base address. However, this table
still needs to use byte offset multiplication because the data is stored as
`void *` so we don't have the same optimizations available to us as Rust's
template generic system. Simple 0 based indexing makes the addition and
multiplication we perform as simple as possible. */

    - The address of a user defined fixed size map allocated on the heap.
    - NULL if the user intends for a dynamic map.

All of the above cases are covered by accepting the pointer at .data and only
evaluating the argument once. This also allows the user to pass a compound
literal to the first argument and eliminate any dangling references, such as
`&(struct My_type[MY_POWER_OF_2_CAPACITY]){}`. However, to accept a map from all
of these sources at compile or runtime, we must implement lazy initialization.

it is fixed size and has data or is dynamic and has not yet been given
