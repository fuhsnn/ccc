@brief The Flat Hash Map Interface

A Flat Hash Map stores elements in a contiguous array and allows the user to
query the map by key in amortized `O(1)` time. Elements in the table may be
copied and moved, especially when rehashing occurs, so no pointer stability is
available in this implementation.

A flat hash map requires the user to provide a pointer to the map, a type, a key
field, a hash function, and a key three way comparator function. The hasher
should be well tailored to the key being stored in the table to prevent
collisions. Good variety in the upper bits of the hashed value will also result
in faster performance. Currently, the flat hash map does not offer any default
hash functions or hash strengthening algorithms so strong hash functions should
be obtained by the user for the data set.

The current implementation will seek to use the best platform specific Single
Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) or Single Register Multiple Data (SRMD)
instructions available. However, if for any reason the user wishes to use the
most portable Single Register Multiple Data fallback implementation, there are
many options.

To use the map as a set, when only keys are needed, wrap a type in a struct or
union. For example a set of `int` could be represented by creating a type
`struct My_int {int key;};`. All interface functions can then be used normally.

If building this library separately to include its library file, add the
flag to the build (and read INSTALL.md for more details).

```
cmake --preset=clang-release -DCCC_FLAT_HASH_MAP_PORTABLE
```

If an install location other than the release folder is desired don't forget
to add the install prefix.

```
cmake --preset=clang-release -DCCC_FLAT_HASH_MAP_PORTABLE \
-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/my/path/
```

If this library is being built as part of your project then define the flag
as part of your configuration.

```
cmake --preset=my-preset -DCCC_FLAT_HASH_MAP_PORTABLE
```

Or, add the flag to your `CMakePresets.json`.

```
"cacheVariables": {
    "CCC_FLAT_HASH_MAP_PORTABLE": "ON"
}
```

Or, enable on a per target basis in your `CMakeLists.txt`.

```
target_compile_definitions(my_target PRIVATE CCC_FLAT_HASH_MAP_PORTABLE)
```

Or finally, just define it before including the flat hash map header.

```
#define CCC_FLAT_HASH_MAP_PORTABLE
#include "ccc/flat_hash_map.h"
```

See the INSTALL.md file for more ways to configure the map for hosted and
freestanding environments.

To shorten names in the interface, define the following preprocessor directive
at the top of your file. The `CCC_` prefix may then be omitted for only this
container.

```
#define FLAT_HASH_MAP_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
#include "ccc/flat_hash_map.h"
```

All types and functions can then be written without the `CCC_` prefix. */

/** @name Initialization Interface
Initialize the container with memory and callbacks. When a fixed size map is
required, the user must declare the type name and size of the map they will use.
Subsequent functions that request an allocator can then be passed the empty
allocator argument, `&(CCC_Allocator){}`. */
/**@{*/

/** @brief Create the underlying fixed size storage for a user declared compound
literal array of the type the user intends to store.
@param[in] user_type_compound_literal_array a compound literal array of the type
around which the map will be built. Must be a power of 2 capacity array.
@param[in] optional_storage_specifier a storage specifier for the backing struct
of array storage may be added on newer compilers such as static.
@warning This should rarely be used. If a fixed size map is desired simply use
the CCC_flat_hash_map_with_storage() initializer. For dynamic maps,
there are also many other options.

This macro is required to support the edge case for the user allocating a fixed
size map dynamically from an allocator at runtime. In this case, the user needs
access to the underlying map storage object to know how many bytes to allocate.
See the below example.

```
struct Val
{
    int key;
    int val;
};

int
main(void)
{
    void *const storage = malloc(
        sizeof(CCC_flat_hash_map_storage_for((struct Val[4096]){}))
    );
    defer free(storage);
    CCC_Flat_hash_map hash_map = CCC_flat_hash_map_for(
        struct Val,
        key,
        hash_key,
        order_vals,
        NULL,
        NULL,
        4096,
        storage
    );
    return 0;
}
```

Usually, using a dynamic map and the reserve interface would be sufficient.
However, the reserve interface only guarantees that at least the needed bytes
are allocated. When the user must know the exact size of the backing object due
to strict memory requirements, this is helpful. Such a use case may be rare, but
must be supported by this container. */
