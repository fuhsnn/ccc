/** @brief Runs a list of test functions and returns the result.
@param[in] test_fn_list all test functions to run in main.
@return a passing test result if all tests pass or failing result if any fail.
All tests to completion even if the overall result is a failure.
@note The check runner also seed the global random `srand` function with a
global static seed that will be reported along with any failed check throughout
the program. This allows for any test that relies on randomness to reproduce the
failed result for debugging.

Return this macro from the main function of the test program. All tests
will run but the testing result for the entire program will be set to CHECK_FAIL
upon the first failure. All functions must return an enum Check_result though
their argument signatures may vary. If a test fails with an error, this runner
will set the overall test state to fail and the user should examine the
individual test that failed with CHECK_FAIL or CHECK_ERROR. */
