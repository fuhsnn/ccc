@brief The Buffer Interface

Buffer usage is similar to a C++ vector, with more flexible functions
provided to support higher level containers and abstractions. While useful
on its own--a stack could be implemented with the provided functions--a buffer
is often used as the lower level abstraction for the flat data structures
in this library that provide more specialized operations. A Buffer does not
require the user accommodate any intrusive elements.

A Buffer offers a more flexible interface than a standard C++ vector. There are
functions that assume elements are stored contiguously from `[0, N)` where `N`
is the count of elements. However, there are also functions that let the user
access any Buffer slot that is within the bounds of Buffer capacity. This
requires the user pay closer attention to Buffer usage but ultimately allows
a wider variety of abstractions on top of the buffer.

Interface functions in the slot management section offer data movement and
writing operations that do not affect the size of the container. If writing a
more complex higher level container that does not need size management these
functions offer more custom control over the buffer.

A Buffer function that accepts an allocator will re-size as required when a new
element is inserted in a contiguous fashion if an allocator is provided.
Interface functions in the allocation management section assume elements are
stored contiguously and adjust size accordingly.

If an allocator is not provided, resizing will not occur and the insertion
function will fail when capacity is reached, returning some value to indicate
failure.

If shorter names are desired, define the following preprocessor directive.

#define BUFFER_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
