@brief The Adaptive Map Interface

An adaptive map offers storage and retrieval of elements sorted on the user
specified key. Once allocated, this container will not move elements in memory
making this container assume pointer stability. Because the data structure is
self-optimizing it is not a suitable map when strict sub-linear runtime bounds
are needed. Also, searching the map is not a const thread-safe operation as
indicated by the function signatures. The map is optimized upon every new
search, attempting to adapt to the usage pattern. In many cases the
self-optimizing structure of the map can be beneficial when considering
non-uniform access patterns. In the best case, repeated searches of the same
value yield an `O(1)` access and many other frequently searched values will be
obtained in constant time.

To shorten names in the interface, define the following preprocessor directive
at the top of your file.

```
#define ADAPTIVE_MAP_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
```

All types and functions can then be written without the `CCC_` prefix. */
