these types is to aid the user in writing correct callback functions, allow
clear error handling, and present a consistent interface to users across
containers. If an allocator is passed to container functions be sure to review

/** @brief An allocation function at the core of all containers.

An allocation function implements the following behavior, when it has been
passed an allocator context. Context is passed to a container upon its
initialization and the programmer may choose how to best utilize this reference
(more on context later).

- If input is NULL and bytes 0, NULL is returned.
- If input is NULL with non-zero bytes, new memory is allocated/returned.
- If input is non-NULL it has been previously allocated by the allocator.
- If input is non-NULL with non-zero size, input is resized to at least bytes
  size. The pointer returned is NULL if resizing fails. Upon success, the
  pointer returned might not be equal to the pointer provided.
- If input is non-NULL and size is 0, input is freed and NULL is returned.

For example, one solution using the standard library allocator might be
implemented as follows (context is not needed):

```
void *
std_allocate(CCC_Allocator_arguments const arguments)
{
    if (!arguments.input && !arguments.bytes)
    {
        return NULL;
    }
    if (!arguments.input)
    {
        return malloc(arguments.bytes);
    }
    if (!arguments.bytes)
    {
        free(arguments.input);
        return NULL;
    }
    return realloc(arguments.input, arguments.bytes);
}
```

However, the above example is only useful if the standard library allocator
is used. Any allocator that implements the required behavior is sufficient.
For example programs that utilize the context parameter, see the sample
programs. Using custom arena allocators or container compositions are cases when
context is needed. */

reference to it. First initialize it statically in a module.

static CCC_Allocator const std_allocator = { .allocate = std_allocate };
int
main(void) {
    container_insert(&container, &(int){1}, &std_allocator);
    return 0;
}

Or, construct the context inline.

```

main(void) {
    struct Arena_allocator arena = arena_initialize();
    container_insert(&container, &(int){1},
                     &(CCC_Allocator){.allocate = std_allocate});
    return 0;
}
```

Or, pass an empty context when allocation is prohibited.

```
int
main(void) {
    struct Arena_allocator arena = arena_initialize();
    container_insert(&container, &(int){1}, &(CCC_Allocator){});
}
```

assume the container will free each element with the provided allocation
function; this function can be used for any other program state to be maintained
before the container frees. If the user has not given permission to the
