@brief The Flat Priority Queue Interface

A flat priority queue is a contiguous container storing elements in heap order.
This offers tightly packed data for efficient push, pop, min/max operations in
`O(lg N)` time.

A flat priority queue can use memory sources from the stack, heap, or data
segment and can be initialized at compile or runtime. The container offers
efficient initialization options such as an `O(N)` heap building initializer.
The flat priority queue also offers a destructive heap sort option if the user
desires an in-place strict `O(N * log(N))` and `O(1)` space sort that does not
use recursion.

Many functions in the interface request a temporary argument be passed as a swap
slot. This is because a flat priority queue is backed by a binary heap and
swaps elements to maintain its properties. Because the user may forgo passing an
allocator, the user must provide this swap slot. An easy way to do this in C99
and later is with anonymous compound literal references. For example, if we have
a `int` flat priority queue we can provide a temporary slot inline to a function
as follows.

```
CCC_flat_priority_queue_pop(&priority_queue, &(int){});
```

Any user defined struct can also use this technique.

```
CCC_flat_priority_queue_pop(&priority_queue, &(struct My_type){});
```

This is the preferred method because the storage remains anonymous and
inaccessible to other code in the calling scope.

To shorten names in the interface, define the following preprocessor directive
at the top of your file.

```
#define FLAT_PRIORITY_QUEUE_USING_NAMESPACE_CCC
```

All types and functions can then be written without the `CCC_` prefix. */
